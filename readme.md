# Zero BS CRM - Code Examples for Developers #

This is the public repository for integration code examples relating to [Zero BS CRM](https://zerobscrm.com). If you're not a developer, try the homepage: [https://zerobscrm.com](https://zerobscrm.com), or the [Knowledgebase](https://zerobscrm.com/kb/).

## Pre-requisites ##

The guides contained in this repo require a basic knowledge of PHP and WordPress programming conventions. They're provided without guaranteed support, to use at your own risk. Please do join the [community slack](https://zerobscrm.com/community/) if you're having issues, but bear in mind that's not the place for general code tutorage.

... with that over, here're the current CRM Code Examples & Developer resources:

* [API Documentation](http://docs.zerobscrm.com/api/)
* [Knowledgebase](https://zerobscrm.com/kb/)
